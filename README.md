Far Away Arduino programming (farduino)

Allows Arduino microcontrollers (uc) to be programmed remotely via an intermediate Linux computer such as a Raspberry Pi when its not practical to provide a direct USB connection to a device.

- Fully integrated to the Arduino IDE for programming activities with normal programming progress showing in the IDE
- Secure and easy interface via standard PuTTY and WinSCP
- Configured via standard Arduino menus - different environments (live, test, etc) and different uc's examples are provided in the sample scripts
- Serial debugging available via standard Linux minicom, but this is not IDE integrated
- Supports Prod and Pre-Prod type environments
- Uses existing Ardiuno resources, so easy to maintain as the Arduino IDE develops
